2. Time of Day: Morning hours (7 AM – 10 AM) are the strongest, slowly declining after that.

3. Coffee, Tea, Bakery and Hot Chocolate bring in the most revenue across all three locations.

4. MochaNY in Astoria performs well in the evening compared to the Hell's Kitchen and Lower Manhattan locations - more than      3K transactions every hour after the peak hour (10 AM) until it closes down for the day.

5. Hell's Kitchen Branch brings in ~$236K, higher than the other two locations and performs best on Tuesdays, Fridays and        Sundays.

6. The Lower Manhattan Branch brings in ~$230K in revenue, lower than the other two branches but still in the same range and     performs best on Mondays (>7K transactions). The last two hours of the day bring in the lowest transaction amount,            especiall compared to the other two branches.

7. Overall all 3 branches have similar revenue contributions with the morning hours being the peak. Product Category             performances are similar across all 3 branches


## Recommendations
   1. Ensure maximum staffing and inventory between 7–10 AM
      
   2. Introduce express combos (Coffee + snack) to increase AOV

   3. Promote evening only offers like evening discounts, bundle offers in Hell's Kitchen and Lower Manhattan branches to           increase evening performance.

   5. Expand inventory of top-selling products including barrista espresso, Chai tea and Hot Chocolate to avoid stockouts.
